# how to use

run `python3 keras_cnn.py` to train, test and save the model as an hd5 reusable file

run `python3 keras_predict.py` to predict on the test dataset

run `python3 keras_own_dig.py` to predict on your personal handwritten digits

# nota

the model works fine with those [digits](savine) but not with others
